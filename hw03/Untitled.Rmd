```

## Task Option #1
Abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent.
(I considered any life expectancy below 55 years as a low life expectancy.)

```{r}

gapminder %>% 
  filter(lifeExp < 55) %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>% 
  count(continent) %>% 
  select(year, n) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  labs(
    title = "Abundance of Countries With a Low Life Expectancy Over Time",
    subtitle = "(Low life expectancy is considered as under 55 years of age.)",
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Number of Countries")

```


## Task Option #2
Maximum and minimum GDP per capita in each of the continents.

```{r}

gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  arrange(year, continent) %>% 
  mutate(maximum = max(gdpPercap), minimum = min(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap == maximum | gdpPercap == minimum) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, gdpPercap, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  labs(
    title = "Maximum and Minimum GDP per capita in each country over the years"
  )

```


## Task Option #5
How is life expectancy changing over time in each continent?

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, group = country)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  labs(
    title = "Changes in Life Expectancy Over Time on Each Continent"
  )
```
